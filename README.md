# NativeScript Sonos Plugin (WIP)
This plugin provides an interface for controlling a Sonos system on a local network from a NativeScript app. It is influenced heavily by the [NodeJS Sonos library](https://github.com/bencevans/node-sonos) created by [Ben Evans](https://github.com/bencevans).

**This is an incomplete, work-in-process plugin. Use accordingly.**

For the complete instructions, see the [README in the `src` directory of this plugin](https://github.com/toddanglin/nativescript-sonos/tree/master/src).
